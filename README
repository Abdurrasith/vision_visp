This is a hybrid tracker using two libraries:
- visp for model-based tracking (http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/visp.html)
- libdtmx for flashcode detection (http://www.libdmtx.org/)

This should work on ubuntu but the CMake for this project is not very sophisticated. 
Therefore, to run this project you'll need to install:
* v4l2
* visp 
* libdtmx
* opencv
* boost. More specifically these parts:
	- program options
	- msm

The tracker is able to initialize itself without any prior information from this kind of patterns:
https://github.com/filipnovotny/flashcode_mbt/raw/master/data/pattern-1.png

First, it finds the flashcode and deduces the model from it.
Afterwards, the model is tracked.
The whole state machine is defined in tracking.h. 
This is also the most interesting file to look at to understand the code.  

General options:
  -d [ --dmtxonly ]                     only detect the datamatrix
  -C [ --video-camera ]                 video from camera
  -s [ --video-source ] arg (=/dev/video1)
                                        video source. For example /dev/video1
  -D [ --data-directory ] arg (=./data) directory from which to load images
  -I [ --single-image ] arg             load this single image (relative to 
                                        data dir)
  -P [ --pattern-name ] arg (=pattern)  name of xml,init and wrl files
  -f [ --showfps ]                      show framerate
  -v [ --verbose ]                      show states of the tracker
  -T [ --dmx-detector-timeout ] arg (=1000)
                                        timeout for datamatrix detection in ms
  -c [ --config-file ] arg (=./data/config.cfg)
                                        config file for the program
  -p [ --show-plot ]                    show variances graph
  --help                                produce help message

Configuration:
  -F [ --flashcode-coordinates ] arg    3D coordinates of the flashcode in 
                                        clockwise order
  -i [ --inner-coordinates ] arg        3D coordinates of the inner region in 
                                        clockwise order
  -o [ --outer-coordinates ] arg        3D coordinates of the outer region in 
                                        clockwise order
  -V [ --variance-file ] arg            file to store variance values
  -l [ --variance-limit ] arg           above this limit the tracker will be 
                                        considered lost and the pattern will be
                                        detected with the flascode
  -S [ --mbt-convergence-steps ] arg (=100)
                                        when a new model is found, how many 
                                        tracking iterations should the tracker 
                                        perform so the model matches the 
                                        projection.
  -H [ --hinkley-range ] arg            pair of alpha, delta values describing 
                                        the two hinkley tresholds

A typical command line is something line:
- To track from camera:  
./tracking -c "/path/config.cfg" -v -D ../flashcode_mbt/data/ -p -H 0.2 0.02 -C

- To track from recording in [data path]/images/%08d.jpg:  
./tracking -c "/path/config.cfg" -v -D ../flashcode_mbt/data/ -p -H 0.2 0.02 -C

- To track a single image in the data directory
./tracking -c "/path/config.cfg" -v -D ../flashcode_mbt/data/ -p -H 0.2 0.02 -I image.png

This will launch tracking with a graphical plot of variances and tracker recovery using hinkley (alpha=0.2, delta=0.02).
Some options (like model definition) are specified in the config file (config.cfg).
You don't need that config file but you'll have to specify everything from command line which can be very exhausting.
