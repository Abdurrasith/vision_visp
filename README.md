visp_tracker
============

The package is composed of one node tracker_mbt and two additional
binaries tracker_mbt_client and tracker_mbt_viewer.

The node tries to track the object as fast as possible but needs to be
initialized using the client. The viewer can be used to monitor the
tracking result.
